_Description: Permit users to have their own configurable finger replies?
 You can decide if efingerd honours users' ~/.efingerd files.
 .
 If someone from network fingers given user, and the user has ~/.efingerd
 file readable and executable for efingerd daemon, this file will be
 executed and its output will be sent to the fingerer.
 .
 This can be either desired or not, depending on your system policy. In
 particular, allowing .efingerd files allows users to cheat about their
 real identity. However, efingerd can be configured to display users' full
 names (from passwd) as the first line of the reply, so they cannot hide
 themselves completely.
 .
 There is however a slight security concern: if you allow .efingerd files,
 these files will be executed under efingerd UID, so malicious users gain
 access to all files owned by efingerd - this becomes important when you
 make efingerd to log into some files writable by the daemon, unless you
 take appropriate precautions.
 .
 If you are the only user, or you trust your users, there is no reason to
 disable .efingerd files (and this is probably a reason you want to install
 efingerd for). However, if you expect your users to be nasty, you should
 better think about protecting from them - in particular, if you enable
 logging, make sure they cannot fiddle with the logfile - this is UP TO
 YOU.

Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Display users' real names?
 By default, efingerd displays users real names (from passwd) as the first
 line of finger reply. You may want to suppress it, but if you allow the
 use of .efingerd files at the same time, be aware that users can hide
 their identity for the fingerer.
 .
 If in doubt, select this option.
