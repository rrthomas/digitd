"This can be either desired or not, depending on your system policy. In "
"particular, allowing .efingerd files allows users to cheat about their real "
"identity. However, efingerd can be configured to display users' full names "
"(from passwd) as the first line of the reply, so they cannot hide themselves "
"completely."

"There is however a slight security concern: if you allow .efingerd files, "
"these files will be executed under efingerd UID, so malicious users gain "
"access to all files owned by efingerd - this becomes important when you make "
"efingerd to log into some files writable by the daemon, unless you take "
"appropriate precautions."

"If you are the only user, or you trust your users, there is no reason to "
"disable .efingerd files (and this is probably a reason you want to install "
"efingerd for). However, if you expect your users to be nasty, you should "
"better think about protecting from them - in particular, if you enable "
"logging, make sure they cannot fiddle with the logfile - this is UP TO YOU."

"By default, efingerd displays users real names (from passwd) as the first "
"line of finger reply. You may want to suppress it, but if you allow the use "
"of .efingerd files at the same time, be aware that users can hide their "
"identity for the fingerer."
