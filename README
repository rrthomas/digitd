digitd is a simple and safe finger daemon, giving you complete control
over what you send to somebody fingering your computer.

It was based on Radovan Garabik’s efingerd, simplified and completely
rewritten.

Requirements: Perl on a system supporting syslog (Linux, Mac OS X,…)

By default, digitd will report that a user does not exist. To allow
yourself to be fingered, create the file .finger in your home
directory. Your home directory must be executable by digitd.

See the man page digitd(8) for more information.


Installation on Debian/Ubuntu
=============================

Unpack the source, change to the top-level source directory, then
type:

  dpkg-buildpackage
  sudo dpkg -i ../digitd*deb


Generic installation
====================

1) Become root

2) Type: make install

3) Add this line to /etc/inetd.conf

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/local/sbin/digitd

Alternatively, you can create your own user under which the daemon should
run, and replace nobody with this user name (e.g. digitd)

If there is already a finger line, comment it out.

Note that the entries are separated by tabs, not spaces.

4) Restart inetd with: killall -HUP inetd
