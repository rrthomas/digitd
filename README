=========================================================

efingerd is a nice finger daemon, giving you complete control over
what are you going to send to somebody fingering your computer.

It is based on my xtell program, which is in turn based on ident2 by
Michael Bacarella.

Requirements: A POSIX system (Linux, Mac OS X, ...)

If you are just an ordinary user and efingerd is already installed by
your friendly administrator, you can take the advantage of it by
making executable .efingerd in your home directory. This program takes
two arguments, the first is the host name (or IP address if not
available) of the remote computer, and the second is the name of your
user. Standard output of this program is then displayed to the person
fingering you. Look at examples/.efingerd for a nice example.


Installation
============

If you have Debian system with all necessary packages installed, type
dpkg-buildpackage (or dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot) in the package's
directory, then type: dpkg -i ../efingerd*deb

Else:

1) look at Makefile

2) type: make
   This should produce the executable efingerd.

3) become root

4) type: make install

5) replace this line in /etc/inetd.conf

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/sbin/in.fingerd

with this line:

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/local/sbin/efingerd

Alternatively, you can create your own user under which the daemon should
run, and replace nobody with this user name (e.g. efingerd)

Notice that the entries are separated by tabs, not spaces.

6) set up your own scripts providing the information about your machine in
   /etc/efingerd/
   You need these scripts:

   /etc/efingerd/list
          - what to display when somebody does finger @your.machine
   /etc/efingerd/luser
          - what to display when somebody fingers user on your machine, and
            the fingered user has a ~/.finger file
   /etc/efingerd/nouser
          - what to display when somebody fingers non-existent user on
            your machine

  If the local user does not have has a file ~/.finger that can be
  found by the daemon (i.e. the user's home directory is executable by
  the daemon), then the daemon will act as if the user did not exist.

  These are normal programs, displaying on standard output desired
  information. These programs are called with following parameters:
  $1 - address of remote machine (IP number if it has not reverse DNS
       entry)
  $2 - name of local user being fingered

  The lines should end in CRLF (as for RFC), but in practise this does not
  make much difference.

  Look at examples*/ for examples.
  Don't forget that these programs must be executable by the daemon UID.

7) restart inetd with killall -HUP inetd
